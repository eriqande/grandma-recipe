This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring 
HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown 
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both
content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

We are going to go through using many of the features of R Markdown whilst writing
up a recipe that can calculate appropriate quantities if you want to increase
the recipe by any factor.

First, we are going to make a subsection dedicated to gramma from whom this
recipe came.  

## Dedication to Gramma

This recipe came from my grandmother whom I always remember used to say:

> You only get to be young once,  
> But you can stay immature forever  
> --Gramma


Notice in the above that we used `>` to make a block quote and we _also_
used two spaces (which, of course, you cannot see!) at the end of each line
to force a line break.

I leave this dedication with a picture of gramma:
